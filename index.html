            <h2>Healthcare</h2>
            <p>
            <strong>Medical & Healthcare:</strong> While I became a doctor and loved caring for patients within the curative care driven hospital settings, I have been always been Doctor beyond prescriptions. Further, working in the areas of public health management and humanitarian medical relief, focused on population health problems like Tuberculosis, Malnutrition, Non-Communicable Diseases (Diabetes, Mental Health, Maternal and Child health), I realised the parodixal growth in unmet health needs solutions for which lie much beyond the medicalcare domain like in preventtive interventions, policy measures, financing models and effective use of technology.
            </p>
            <p>
            While focuing on Population Health, I had the opportunity to see how we can solve the health problems at scale using technology. While working on Tubercuslos Control, I Had the opportunity closely witness and work towards development of a digital web-based platform "Nikshay" designed to fight agasint Tubercuslosis, a significant problem across Indian states. With Nikshay one can track the patient right from the day of suspicion until the eventual cure that might take couple of years as well. With all the check-ups, test results, medications records to help track the health of lakhs of patients and act in time.
            </p>
            <p>
            While Nikshay showed its impact in controlling TB, India could work on next biggest platform of CoWin, agaisnt Covid, what most of the Indians are aware and proud off. Not just in India, I could witness and role of tech in driving better heatlhcare outcomes in diverse societies. While it costs much more in developed nations, comparable, significant improvements were possible for African contexts at a fraction of costs what it would take for developed nations. My experiences across have refined my understanding how technology when designed and delivered properly could be an balancer of inequities and gives us the opportunity to immensly help in increasing access to care.

            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Technology & entrepreneruship</strong> have been facinating for me through out, although these have been at the edge of my core academic areas that I pursued and worked on primarily. 
                </p>
                <p>
                My initial brush with technoloy has been exciting and most memorable, where I could set up an Feature phone and sms based Vaccination related information sharing and reminders project all by myself in 2009 using an open source solution "FrontlineSMS" over a opensouse SQL server and a Wavecom Modem, acting as a SMS gateway making a simple but impactful solution overall, similar but expensive solution that is possible with current expensive alternatives.. for exxample "WhatsApp + Interakt+ Haptik Ecosystem for chat not based responses / reminders.
              </p>
